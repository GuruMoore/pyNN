sANNd (renamed as pyNN is taken) - AI research sandbox. Each phase of the network is customizable via inputed terms and connections. 

This project's goal is to be the basis of a much larger project. For now, the focus is targeted on solidifying the foundation: sANNd.

TL;DR / summary: AI is cool! Right? Why does it take large budgets and/or several datacenters to produce reasonable responses within a resaonable timeframe?

  -The aim of this project is to evovle the idea of simulating organic brain function(s) away from stricly mathematical equations.
  
  --It doesn't prevent or penalize using stricly mathematical equations 
  
  --It allows any Python "callable" to represent what is traditionally thought of as a Neuron, or Layer, or as previously mentioned - literally any phase of the network.


I will be using this in ways that I hope will set the standard for AI research going forward, and hopefully break it free from the shackles of GPU/specialized hardware.
